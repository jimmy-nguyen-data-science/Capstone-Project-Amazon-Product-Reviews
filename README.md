# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to compare home entertainment streaming devices across different competitors in 2022. Based on the technical specifications alone it is not enough insight for comparison, rather it is more interesting to understand the consumer perception and opinion of the product. Thus, we want to utilize text mining techniques by using information from Amazon product reviews such the review title, the review message and the product rating. We can use this information to understand how customer perceive each brand through sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and predictive product ratings.

# Data Science Objectives

The data science objective is to provide an in-depth analysis on streaming devices in 2022. This includes insights from sentiment analysis where we can monitor trends and observe overall opinion towards the brand and product. Then a topic modeling report on detecting word and phrase patterns which can cluster word groups and similar expressions about customers’ opinions. Lastly, for the multiclass-classification models, we will aim to achieve the highest accuracy score as the performance metric and deploy it as a web-application where it can predict live product ratings based on a user’s review.
